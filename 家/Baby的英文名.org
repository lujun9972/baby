#+DESCRIPTION:

Baby有英文名了！名字叫做 *Geo*, which stands for *Good English Owner*.
而且 =geo= 在英文中是 =大地、地球= 的意思，正应了周易中的 =地势坤、君子以厚德载物=.
这个名字真是太棒了。

事实上，这个名字是 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Umizoomi][team umizoomi(数学城小兄妹)]] 中那个小弟弟的名字

Geo - Milli's younger brother who travels on his Super Skates while wearing a blue helmet and shirt. He has abilities related to geometric shapes and wears a Shape Belt that can create objects by assembling shapes and then singing "Super Shapes". Often when Team Umizoomi is stuck and needs a vehicle to assist them, Geo will figure out what they need, present a blueprint for the vehicle needed, and interact with the child viewer to assemble shapes needed to fill in the blueprint. He also has a Shape Magnet to help him find shapes through obstacles and a Shape Splitter to help him split shapes.
